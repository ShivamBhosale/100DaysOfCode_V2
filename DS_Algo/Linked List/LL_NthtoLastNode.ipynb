    "Imagine you have a bunch of nodes and a \"block\" which is n-nodes wide. We could walk this \"block\" all the way down the list, and once the front of the block reached the end, then the other end of the block would be a the Nth node!\n",

    "<li> Once the right_point has hit the tail, we know that the left point is at the target.\n",
