Pros
- Bridges the gap b/w elegance and complexity
- Reduces the need for complex loops and auxiliary DS.
- Can reduces time complexity easily with memoization.
- Works really well with recursive structures like trees and graphs.

Cons
- Slowness due to CPU overhead.
- can lead to out of memory errors/stack overflow exceptions.
- can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed.
